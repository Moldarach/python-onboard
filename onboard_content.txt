onboard topics to cover:

i guess at the very start say what python is
and how you need packages (math, cmath, numpy, scipy, maybe matplotlib)
mention how numpy, scipy are external packages
tell people how to install python correctly
encourage installing jupyter/anaconda since it'll include numpy
also because it's a good idea for ee 241 which you need to graduate
i guess if you really don't want to install anything, you can use an online REPL like here:
https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html

i think i intend to make this onboard teach you the python you should know for this class rather 
than everything you should actually know to do scientific-computing: explore further or take amath
courses if interested

	onboard content:
basic python, like indenting, how to print, general syntax

arrays (vectors i guess), and matrices
array indexing
solving matrices (good for solving node voltage and mesh current)

complex numbers in python 
getting abs and phase of complex numbers
note switching between degrees and radians

partial fraction decomp (scipy residue)
