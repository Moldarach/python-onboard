issues:

(8/30/24)
-each time Pyodide is ran, it does not clear memory, so any
  variable you previously had created will have it's old value
  even if it isn't explicitly declared in the current script
  anymore. This will likely cause confusion, and the only 
  ways I can think to fix this are by deleting all the variables
  in globals, or restart the interpreter on each execution.
  Deleting globals seems jank, but restarting the interpreter
  will not work because it takes too long to load.
