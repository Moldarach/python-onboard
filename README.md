# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- W3Schools for the [sidebar](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp#) and [tabs](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp) code
- ritabratamaiti for the embedded Python interpeter code, which I largely lifted from their [pyRunBrowser project](https://github.com/ritabratamaiti/pyRunBrowser/tree/main). I changed a few small things such as the Pyodide version.
